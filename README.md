# EchoBot: Real-Time TTS Chat Assistant

EchoBot is a real-time text-to-speech (TTS) assistant that combines a local language model with VITS to generate expressive, controllable voice responses directly from text input.

Built for experimentation, local privacy, and low-latency speech synthesis.

## Key Features
- End-to-end speech synthesis using VITS (no vocoder required)
- Local language model (e.g., Falcon, TinyLLaMA) for LLM-based replies
- Control over pitch and (optional) emotion via UI
- Optional microphone input via Gradio
- Fully offline-ready (no OpenAI or external APIs required)
